# About
This app builds an intuitive and completely dynamic readme file for your next project. No more having to remember Markdown syntax all you have to do is answer questions about your project and the code does the rest.

Of all of my applications that I have built, this one gets the most use from me. All of my readmes were build using this app and it truly helps solve the problem of writing an informative readme. At its core, it is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).


## Installation
1. Users will navigate to the [github repository](https://github.com/AndreDiop/Readme-Generator) to clone the repository.

2. To clone and run this application, you will need Git and required NPM dependencies installed on your computer. Inside of your command line editor do the following:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreDiop/Readme-Generator.git

npm install
```
3.Start the server instance on your local machine
 ```bash

npm start
```




## Usage

You would want to use this app if you wanted a way to have a beautifully formatted readme file for your project without the hassle of having to write it all out yourself. a better readme can make or break your project, so just let this application do the heavy lifting so you can focus on your project and not writing the readme.

## Test Instructions


The packages used on this script are from NPM. Full documentation can be found on www.npmjs.com. There is no unexpected behavior in the code that I know of.
