# About
This app builds an intuitive and completely dynamic readme file for your next project. No more having to remember Markdown syntax all you have to do is answer questions about your project and the code does the rest.
## Installation
In your bash terminal, navigate to the folder containing the 'index.js' file. Once in that directory, return 'node index.js.
## Usage
You would want to use this app if you wanted a way to have a beautifully formatted readme file for your project with out the hassle of having to right it all out yourself. a better readme can make or break your project, so just let this script do the heavy lifting so you can focus on your project and not writing the readme.
## Test Instructions
The packages used on this script are from NPM. Full documentation can be found on www.npmjs.com. There are no unexpected behavior in the code that I know of.
